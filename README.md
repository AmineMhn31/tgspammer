# Introduction #

The software is used to send out advertising messages or just plain flooding the Telegram app.

Previously sold, but due to the small number of sales and tired of obligations to customers - we put this spammer in the public.

As much as possible, we recommend that you use the repository for educational purposes only (you get the idea). We do not recommend that you use the software for malicious purposes, we have warned you.

Also, we monitor the status of your account and do everything to ensure that you do not get blocked, which makes using the program safer than manual mailing.
In case of blocking, we notify you via GUI window.
